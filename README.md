# An Object-Oriented Adventure

This project demonstrates the use of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in JavaScript to simulate an adventure game. It includes the creation of various classes, such as `Character`, `Adventurer`, and `Companion`, each with unique properties and methods.

## Features

- **Character Class**: Basic character with a name, health, and inventory.
- **Adventurer Class**: Inherits from `Character`, with additional role and actions.
- **Companion Class**: Represents a companion with superpowers.
- **Subclasses for Roles**: Includes classes for specific adventurer roles such as `Healer` and `Wizard`.

## Setup

Clone this repository and open `index.js` to explore the object-oriented structure and gameplay mechanics.

## How to Play

Create characters and companions, assign roles like Fighter, Healer, or Wizard, and simulate actions such as scouting and healing.

## License
